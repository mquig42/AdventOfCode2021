;;;Today we're pathfinding through a graph. First step is to build some
;;;representation of that graph. Maybe a hash table where the key is a cave
;;;and the value is a list of connected locations.

;;;Paths can't pas through a lowercase-named cave more than once, and
;;;I will assume that rule is there to prevent cycles

;;;There's probably a way to use recursive mapping and filtering to
;;;enumerate all paths. Would require some thought.
