;;;Currently can read data and do the insertions. Each insertion runs in linear
;;;time, but the length of the list will increase significantly each round.
;;;After some experimentation, this approach really can't go much past 10.

;;;Part 2 asks for 40 rounds of insertion. I estimate this could take up to
;;;20TB of RAM. There must be a way to do this without actually generating
;;;the polymer string.

;;;Try finding the frequencies of each letter after each of 10 rounds
;;;and doing regression analysis. That might not be precise enough, but
;;;I don't have any better ideas.
