# AdventOfCode2021

Solutions to Advent of Code 2021. I've used Python for the last two years, so this time I'll try something completely different: LISP. Specifically, the [SICP Scheme](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) language package for [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), because [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) is the best documentation I've found for learning this.

I plan to at least try each day with Scheme, but I might end up going back to Python for some of them.
