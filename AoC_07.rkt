;;;Optimization problem. Given a list of submarines in different positions,
;;;find the minimum fuel required to move them all to the same position
;;;using two different methods of calculating fuel consumption

;;;Since the only difference between parts one and two are the different
;;;movement-cost functions, it was easy to refactor.
;;;I'm starting to like functional programming.

;;;Right now my part 2 solution takes over 30 seconds to run. This could be
;;;improved by precomputing all the movement costs and making a lookup table.
;;;Also, didn't Euler come up with an algebraic solution? Or was it Gauss?
;;;That would be even better.
