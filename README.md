# AdventOfCode2021

Solutions to Advent of Code 2021. I've used Python for the last two years, so this time I'll try something completely different: LISP. Specifically, the [SICP Scheme](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) language package for [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), because [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) is the best documentation I've found for learning this.

I plan to at least try each day with Scheme, but I might end up going back to Python for some of them.

Edit 2021-12-04: Switching from SICP scheme to Racket. This just means I'm using the whole language instead of a subset designed to accompany one specific textbook. There's a much larger standard library, including some data structures I'm sure will be useful later.
